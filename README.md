This project demonstrated the effective use of Python for end-to-end data analysis across 
diverse data typesâ€”tabular (CSV), image, and text. Each dataset presented unique challenges, 
from handling outliers and scaling features in the Air Quality Health Impact dataset, to 
designing a custom CNN for image classification, and applying deep learning with word 
embeddings for text-based difficulty classification. 
Through systematic preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using relevant statistical 
and machine learning techniques, meaningful insights were extracted and strong predictive 
models were developed. Random Forest and XGBoost emerged as top performers in the 
structured data task, the CNN achieved high accuracy in image classification, and LSTM with 
embeddings significantly improved performance in the text task. 
The project highlights the importance of tailored preprocessing, model selection, and metric
based evaluation in driving successful data-driven solutions. It reflects a comprehensive 
application of theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets and builds a strong foundation for 
future work in data science and AI.
